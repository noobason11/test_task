    On the first graph, you can see the ratio of visits to the site and income by region, draw conclusions by regions
with poor conversion and optimize advertising, PR, etc.
    In the second graph, we see that mobile brings little income per visitors, so you need to go deeper and explore
this at the level of cross-channel sequences.
    On graph 3, we see that the situation in terms of visits and income + is the same, but almost all traffic is referral,
therefore it is necessary to increase the sample and if the situation does not change, then to increase brand awareness.
